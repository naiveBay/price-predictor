## This will be used to build functions that test the integrity of our databases.
#
# Functions:
#   - itemNumberCheck: checks that no db has the same item listed twice
#   - itemTitleCheck:  checks to see how many items have the same title (relisted items ?)
#   - characterCheck:  check uniform character usage, eg " = &quot;
